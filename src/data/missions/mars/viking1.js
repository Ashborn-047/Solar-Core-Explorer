    achievements: [
        'First successful Mars landing',
        'Operated for 6 years on surface',
        'Took first panoramic photos of Mars'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Biology Instrument',
        'Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer',
        'X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer',
        'Cameras'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        "The lander's cameras took over 1400 photos",
        'It tested soil for signs of life (results still debated)',
        'Cost $1 billion in 1970s dollars'
    ],
    motivation: "NASA sought to answer one of humanity's biggest questions: Is there life on Mars? Viking was designed to land on the Martian surface and directly test the soil for signs of biological activity.",
    context: 'In the 1970s, Mars was still a mystery. Some scientists believed life could exist there. The Soviet Union had attempted Mars landings but failed. Viking was America\'s bold answer.',
    outcome: "Viking 1 landed on July 20, 1976—exactly 7 years after Apollo 11. It operated for over 6 years, sent stunning photos, and conducted biology experiments. Results were ambiguous: some tests suggested life, others didn't.",
    legacy: 'Viking transformed our understanding of Mars. Its data showed a cold, dry, irradiated world—but not lifeless. The debate over its life-detection results continues today and motivates current Mars missions.'
