    name: 'Perseverance',
    agency: 'NASA',
    color: '#00aaff',
    target: 'Mars',
    launch: '2021',
    status: 'Active',
    description: 'Most advanced rover ever sent to Mars. Carries the Ingenuity helicopter.',
    scientific_goal: 'Search for signs of ancient life and cache samples for Earth return.',
    importance: 'Ingenuity achieved first powered flight on another planet.',
    image: '/assets/missions/perseverance.webp',
    achievements: [
        'First powered flight on Mars (Ingenuity)',
        'Producing oxygen from Martian atmosphere',
        'Collecting samples for future return to Earth'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Mastcam-Z Cameras',
        'SuperCam Laser',
        'MOXIE Oxygen Generator',
        'PIXL X-ray Spectrometer'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        'Ingenuity has made 70+ flights (designed for just 5)',
        "The rover carries a piece of Martian meteorite (returning it home)",
        '"Percy" has collected 20+ sample tubes for Earth return'
    ],
    motivation: "Building on Curiosity's discoveries, NASA designed Perseverance to directly search for biosignatures—fossilized evidence of past Martian life. The sample return aspect represents humanity's best chance to definitively answer if life existed on Mars.",
    context: 'Jezero Crater was chosen because it contains an ancient river delta—an ideal place for life to have thrived and for fossils to be preserved. The Ingenuity helicopter was included as a technology demonstration.',
    outcome: 'Perseverance landed perfectly in February 2021. Ingenuity far exceeded expectations with 70+ flights. The rover has collected dozens of samples revealing diverse geology. MOXIE successfully produced oxygen from the Martian atmosphere.',
    legacy: 'Perseverance is preparing the most important interplanetary sample return in history. Its samples may contain proof of past Martian life. Ingenuity proved aerial exploration of other worlds is possible, changing future mission designs.'
