    name: 'Curiosity',
    agency: 'NASA',
    color: '#00aaff',
    target: 'Mars',
    launch: '2012',
    status: 'Active',
    description: 'Car-sized rover exploring Gale Crater. Still operational after 12+ years.',
    scientific_goal: "Investigate Mars' climate and geology; assess habitability.",
    importance: 'Confirmed ancient Mars could have supported microbial life.',
    image: '/assets/missions/curiosity.webp',
    achievements: [
        'Found organic molecules on Mars',
        'Confirmed ancient lake existed in Gale Crater',
        'Detected seasonal methane variations'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'ChemCam Laser',
        'SAM Chemistry Lab',
        'Mastcam Cameras',
        'REMS Weather Station'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        'Weighs 899 kg—size of a small car',
        'Landed using a "sky crane" system',
        'Sings Happy Birthday to itself every August 5'
    ],
    motivation: 'After previous rovers found water evidence, NASA wanted to determine if Mars was ever habitable. Curiosity carried a full chemistry laboratory to analyze soil and rocks in unprecedented detail.',
    context: "The Mars Science Laboratory was NASA's most ambitious Mars mission. After Spirit and Opportunity's success, a larger, more capable rover was designed to answer the question: Could life have existed on Mars?",
    outcome: "Curiosity confirmed that Gale Crater once held a freshwater lake with conditions suitable for microbial life. It found organic molecules, seasonal methane, and evidence of a thicker ancient atmosphere.",
    legacy: "Curiosity proved Mars was once habitable. Its findings shaped our understanding of Mars' wet past and informed the design of Perseverance. It pioneered technologies like the sky crane landing system."
