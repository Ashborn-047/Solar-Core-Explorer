    description: 'First mission to soft-land near the lunar south pole.',

    achievements: [
        'First soft landing near lunar south pole',
        'Fourth nation to soft-land on Moon',
        'Pragyan rover analyzed lunar soil composition'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Vikram Lander',
        'Pragyan Rover',
        'LIBS Spectrometer',
        'Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer',
        'Seismometer'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        'Landing was broadcast live and watched by millions globally',
        'The rover found sulfur in lunar soil—a first',
        'India spent about $75 million—cheaper than many Hollywood movies'
    ],
    motivation: "After Chandrayaan-2's crash landing in 2019, India was determined to prove it could soft-land on the Moon. The south pole was chosen because it may contain water ice useful for future bases.",
    context: "Chandrayaan-2 came within 2 km of success before crashing. India redesigned the lander with more redundancy and simpler systems. The world watched, especially as Russia's Luna-25 had just crashed days earlier.",
    outcome: 'On August 23, 2023, Vikram touched down successfully near the lunar south pole. The Pragyan rover operated for 14 days, confirming the presence of sulfur and other elements in the regolith before entering hibernation.',
    legacy: "Chandrayaan-3 made India the fourth nation to soft-land on the Moon and the first to land near the south pole. It boosted India's space industry globally and proved cost-effective exploration is possible."
