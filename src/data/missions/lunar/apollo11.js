    name: 'Apollo 11',
    agency: 'NASA',
    color: '#0066cc',
    target: 'Moon',
    launch: '1969',
    status: 'Historic',
    description: 'First crewed mission to land on the Moon. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on another world.',
    scientific_goal: 'Perform a crewed lunar landing and return safely to Earth.',
    importance: 'The defining achievement of human spaceflight. "One small step for man..."',

    achievements: [
        'First humans on the Moon',
        'Collected 21.5 kg of lunar samples',
        'Placed seismometer and laser reflector on surface'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Lunar Module Eagle',
        'Passive Seismic Experiment',
        'Laser Ranging Retroreflector',
        'Solar Wind Composition Experiment'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        "Neil Armstrong's heart rate hit 150 bpm during landing",
        'Buzz Aldrin took communion on the Moon',
        'The astronauts were quarantined for 21 days after return'
    ],
    motivation: "President Kennedy's 1961 challenge to land a man on the Moon before the decade's end was driven by Cold War competition. America needed a dramatic victory after the Soviets' early space achievements.",
    context: 'The Apollo program was born from national pride and geopolitical rivalry. NASA had 8 years and $25 billion (1960s dollars) to achieve what seemed impossible. Previous missions (Apollo 8, 9, 10) tested the components needed for lunar landing.',
    outcome: 'On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, followed by Buzz Aldrin. They spent 2.5 hours outside, collected samples, planted the American flag, and received a phone call from President Nixon. Michael Collins orbited above in the Command Module.',
    legacy: "Apollo 11 remains humanity's greatest exploration achievement. It proved international cooperation in space was possible, led to advances in computer technology, materials science, and inspired generations of scientists and engineers. The lunar samples are still being studied today."
