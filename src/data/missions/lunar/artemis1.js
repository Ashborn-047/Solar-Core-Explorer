    launch: '2022',
    status: 'Success',
    description: 'Uncrewed test flight of the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft.',
    scientific_goal: 'Validate deep space systems for crewed Artemis missions.',

    achievements: [
        'SLS performed flawlessly on maiden flight',
        'Orion traveled 1.4 million miles',
        'Set distance record for human-rated spacecraft'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Orion Crew Module',
        'European Service Module',
        'CubeSat payloads'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        'Orion came within 80 miles of the lunar surface',
        'Carried a "Snoopy" zero-gravity indicator',
        'The mission patch included a red chevron honoring Apollo'
    ],
    motivation: 'After the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011, NASA spent a decade developing the Space Launch System and Orion. Artemis I was the crucial first test to prove these systems could take humans back to the Moon.',
    context: "The Artemis program aims to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon by the mid-2020s. After 50+ years since Apollo, returning to the Moon requires entirely new hardware tested in deep space conditions.",
    outcome: 'Artemis I launched on November 16, 2022 after years of delays. The mission was a complete success: SLS performed flawlessly, and Orion traveled farther from Earth than any human-rated spacecraft ever had, spending 25 days in space.',
    legacy: "Artemis I validated NASA's Moon-to-Mars architecture. It proved the SLS rocket and Orion capsule can support crewed lunar missions, setting the stage for Artemis II (crewed lunar flyby) and Artemis III (first crewed landing since 1972)."
