    target: 'Moon',
    launch: '2009',
    status: 'Active',
    description: 'Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, mapping the Moon in unprecedented detail.',
    scientific_goal: 'Identify safe landing sites and locate potential resources.',
    importance: 'Foundation for Artemis program landing site selection.',
    image: 'https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA12223/PIA12223~medium.jpg',
    achievements: [
        'Mapped entire lunar surface at 100m resolution',
        'Located Apollo landing sites from orbit',
        'Discovered water ice in permanently shadowed craters'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'LROC Camera',
        'Diviner Radiometer',
        'Mini-RF Radar',
        'CRaTER'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        'Has been orbiting the Moon for over 14 years',
        'Can spot objects as small as a desk on the lunar surface',
        'Helped select the landing site for Artemis III'
    ],
    motivation: 'After decades away from the Moon, NASA needed updated maps and resource surveys to plan the next generation of lunar exploration. The Constellation program (Artemis predecessor) required detailed reconnaissance.',
    context: 'In 2009, NASA was preparing for a return to the Moon. The last comprehensive lunar mapping was done in the 1990s. LRO was designed to scout ahead for future crewed missions.',
    outcome: "LRO has become one of NASA's longest-running planetary missions. It mapped the entire Moon at high resolution, found water ice in polar craters, and even photographed the Apollo landing sites with enough detail to see astronaut footpaths.",
    legacy: "LRO's data is the foundation for every modern lunar mission. Its discovery of polar water ice transformed our understanding of lunar resources and made permanent Moon bases seem feasible."
