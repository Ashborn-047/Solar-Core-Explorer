export const change4 = {
    name: "Chang'e 4",
    agency: 'CNSA',
    color: '#ffcc00',
    target: 'Moon',
    launch: '2019',
    status: 'Active',
    description: 'First mission to land on the far side of the Moon.',
    scientific_goal: 'Explore the Von Kármán crater and conduct radio astronomy experiments.',
    importance: 'Historic first: No spacecraft had ever landed on the lunar far side.',
    image: '/assets/missions/change4.webp',
    achievements: [
        'First landing on lunar far side',
        'Deployed Yutu-2 rover',
        'Conducted first radio astronomy from far side'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Yutu-2 Rover',
        'Low Frequency Radio Spectrometer',
        'Lunar Penetrating Radar',
        'Panoramic Camera'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        "The far side is shielded from Earth's radio noise—ideal for radio astronomy",
        'Required a relay satellite at L2 point for communication',
        'Grew the first plants on the Moon (cotton seedlings)'
    ],
    motivation: 'China aimed to achieve a historic first that no other nation had accomplished. Landing on the far side showcased advanced navigation and communication capabilities.',
    context: 'The lunar far side was long considered too risky due to communication challenges. China deployed a relay satellite (Queqiao) at Earth-Moon L2 to solve this problem.',
    outcome: "Chang'e 4 successfully landed on January 3, 2019. The Yutu-2 rover has traveled over 1.5 km, discovering unusual subsurface materials and conducting the first biological experiment on the Moon.",
    legacy: "Chang'e 4 established China as a leading lunar explorer. Its relay satellite communication system proved new techniques for deep space exploration, paving the way for Chang'e 5 sample return."
