    achievements: [
        'First object to reach another celestial body',
        'Confirmed no significant lunar magnetic field',
        'Carried Soviet pennants to the Moon'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Magnetometer',
        'Geiger counter',
        'Micrometeorite detector',
        'Scintillation counter'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        'Traveling at 3.3 km/s, it was the fastest man-made object at its time',
        'The mission lasted only 33.5 hours',
        'A sphere of Soviet pennants was designed to scatter on impact'
    ],
    motivation: 'The Soviet Union sought to demonstrate technological superiority over the United States during the Cold War. After successfully launching Sputnik in 1957, the Moon became the next frontier to conquer.',
    context: 'In the late 1950s, the Space Race was heating up between the USSR and USA. The Soviets had already shocked the world with Sputnik, and reaching the Moon would cement their lead in space technology.',
    outcome: 'Luna 2 successfully impacted the Moon on September 14, 1959, becoming the first spacecraft to reach another celestial body. It confirmed the lack of a significant lunar magnetic field and no radiation belts around the Moon.',
    legacy: 'Luna 2 proved that interplanetary travel was possible and set the stage for more ambitious lunar missions. It intensified the Space Race and pushed the United States to accelerate their own lunar program.'
