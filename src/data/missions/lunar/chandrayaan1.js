    achievements: [
        'First Indian mission beyond Earth orbit',
        'Discovered water molecules on lunar surface',
        'Created high-resolution 3D lunar atlas'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Moon Impact Probe',
        'Terrain Mapping Camera',
        'Chandrayaan Imaging X-ray Spectrometer',
        'Moon Mineralogy Mapper (NASA)'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        'Cost only $54 million—one of the cheapest lunar missions ever',
        'The Moon Impact Probe carried the Indian flag to the Moon',
        'Lost contact after 312 days but exceeded primary mission goals'
    ],
    motivation: 'India wanted to join the elite club of lunar explorers and demonstrate its growing space capabilities. The mission aimed to establish ISRO as a credible partner for international space collaborations.',
    context: 'In the early 2000s, only the US, USSR, ESA, and Japan had sent probes to the Moon. India saw lunar exploration as a way to boost national prestige and develop advanced space technology.',
    outcome: "Chandrayaan-1's Moon Mineralogy Mapper made a historic discovery: water molecules were present on the lunar surface, concentrated near the poles. This reshaped our understanding of the Moon as a potential resource destination.",
    legacy: 'Chandrayaan-1 put India on the map as a serious space power. Its water discovery influenced subsequent missions by all major space agencies. ISRO gained international credibility and partnerships.'
