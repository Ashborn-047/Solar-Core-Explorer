    description: 'Lunar mission aborted after an oxygen tank exploded. Crew returned safely in a dramatic rescue.',

    achievements: [
        'Successful crew rescue from 400,000 km away',
        "Demonstrated NASA's crisis management",
        'Used lunar module as lifeboat'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Command Module Odyssey',
        'Lunar Module Aquarius',
        'ALSEP (never deployed)'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        'The crew used duct tape to create a CO2 scrubber adapter',
        'They swung around the Moon to slingshot back to Earth',
        'Temperature in the spacecraft dropped to 38°F (3°C)'
    ],
    motivation: 'Apollo 13 was intended to be the third lunar landing, focusing on scientific exploration of the Fra Mauro highlands. NASA wanted to expand lunar knowledge beyond the initial landing sites.',
    context: 'By 1970, the Apollo program was in full swing. Apollo 11 and 12 had successfully landed, and public attention was waning. Apollo 13 was expected to be routine—until it became anything but.',
    outcome: 'An oxygen tank exploded 56 hours into the mission, crippling the spacecraft. The crew—Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise—used the Lunar Module as a lifeboat. After 4 tense days of improvisation and careful navigation, they splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean.',
    legacy: 'Apollo 13 is often called NASA\'s "successful failure." It demonstrated the importance of mission control teamwork, contingency planning, and human resilience. The incident led to major spacecraft redesigns and improved safety protocols that influenced all future space missions.'
