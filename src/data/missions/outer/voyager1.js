    name: 'Voyager 1',
    agency: 'NASA',
    color: '#ff4444',
    target: 'Interstellar Space',
    launch: '1977',
    status: 'Active',
    description: 'First spacecraft to cross the heliopause. Carries the Golden Record.',
    scientific_goal: 'Study the outer Solar System and interstellar medium.',
    importance: "Humanity's furthest ambassador. Now over 24 billion km from Earth.",
    image: '/assets/missions/voyager1.webp',
    achievements: [
        'First spacecraft to enter interstellar space',
        'Took "Pale Blue Dot" photo of Earth',
        'Still transmitting data after 47 years'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Cosmic Ray Detector',
        'Plasma Science Experiment',
        'Magnetometer',
        'Golden Record'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        'Traveling at 17 km/s—would reach Alpha Centauri in 73,000 years',
        'The Golden Record contains greetings in 55 languages',
        'Carl Sagan helped select the Golden Record contents'
    ],
    motivation: 'A rare planetary alignment in the late 1970s allowed a "Grand Tour" of the outer planets. NASA designed Voyager to exploit this once-in-175-year opportunity to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.',
    context: 'The outer Solar System was almost unknown. Only Pioneer 10/11 had ventured past the asteroid belt. Voyager carried advanced cameras and instruments to transform our understanding of the gas giants.',
    outcome: 'Voyager 1 flew past Jupiter (1979) and Saturn (1980), discovering active volcanoes on Io and complex ring structures. Its trajectory was altered to pass close to Titan, sacrificing Uranus/Neptune visits. In 2012, it became the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space.',
    legacy: 'Voyager 1 is humanity\'s most distant explorer, carrying our message to the cosmos. The "Pale Blue Dot" image—Earth as a tiny speck—became a powerful symbol of our place in the universe. Its instruments continue providing data about interstellar space.'
