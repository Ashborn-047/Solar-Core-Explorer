    target: 'Neptune',
    launch: '1977',
    status: 'Active',
    description: 'Only spacecraft to have visited Uranus and Neptune.',
    scientific_goal: 'Conduct close-up studies of all four gas giants.',
    importance: 'Provided the only close-up images of Uranus and Neptune.',

    achievements: [
        'Only spacecraft to visit Uranus and Neptune',
        'Discovered 16 moons across all four planets',
        'Entered interstellar space in 2018'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Imaging Science System',
        'Ultraviolet Spectrometer',
        'Plasma Wave Experiment',
        'Golden Record'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        "Actually launched before Voyager 1 (but took a longer route)",
        "Discovered Neptune's Great Dark Spot",
        'Still communicating despite being 20 billion km away'
    ],
    motivation: 'While Voyager 1 was optimized for Saturn/Titan, Voyager 2 was designed to complete the Grand Tour—visiting all four outer planets. This required precise trajectory planning across a 12-year journey.',
    context: "After Voyager 1's Saturn flyby, only Voyager 2 remained capable of reaching Uranus and Neptune. No other spacecraft has visited these ice giants, making Voyager 2's data irreplaceable.",
    outcome: 'Voyager 2 visited Jupiter (1979), Saturn (1981), Uranus (1986), and Neptune (1989). It discovered active geysers on Triton, the strangely tilted magnetic field of Uranus, and Neptune\'s supersonic winds. In 2018, it joined Voyager 1 in interstellar space.',
    legacy: "Voyager 2 remains our only window to the ice giants. Its data is still being analyzed. No mission to Uranus or Neptune has been launched since, making Voyager 2's observations 35+ years old—yet still our best."
