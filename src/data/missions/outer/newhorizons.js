    description: 'First spacecraft to fly by Pluto and a Kuiper Belt object (Arrokoth).',

    achievements: [
        'First Pluto flyby',
        'First Kuiper Belt object visited (Arrokoth)',
        "Discovered Pluto's geological activity"
    ],
    instruments: [
        'LORRI Camera',
        'Ralph Visible/IR Imager',
        'REX Radio Experiment',
        'PEPSSI Particle Detector'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        "Traveled 3 billion miles in 9.5 years to reach Pluto",
        "Carries a piece of SpaceShipOne and Clyde Tombaugh's ashes",
        'Pluto\'s "heart" is named Tombaugh Regio'
    ],
    motivation: "Pluto was the only planet (later dwarf planet) never visited by spacecraft. After decades of planning, New Horizons was designed to finally reveal this mysterious frozen world at the edge of our Solar System.",
    context: 'By 2006, Pluto had not been explored despite being known since 1930. New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched, yet still took 9.5 years to reach Pluto. It carried ashes of Pluto\'s discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh.',
    outcome: 'On July 14, 2015, New Horizons flew within 12,500 km of Pluto. It revealed a stunning world: nitrogen glaciers, ice mountains, and a thin atmosphere. The heart-shaped Sputnik Planitia became an iconic image. In 2019, it flew by Arrokoth, the most distant object ever visited.',
    legacy: "New Horizons showed Pluto is geologically active and complex—not a dead ice ball. It opened the Kuiper Belt for exploration. The mission continues into the Kuiper Belt, potentially targeting more objects through the 2030s."
