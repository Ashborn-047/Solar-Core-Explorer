    name: 'Cassini-Huygens',
    agency: 'NASA/ESA',
    color: '#ffaa00',
    target: 'Saturn',
    launch: '1997',
    status: 'Completed',
    description: 'Orbited Saturn for 13 years. Huygens probe landed on Titan.',
    scientific_goal: 'Study Saturn, its rings, and moons in unprecedented detail.',
    importance: "Revealed Titan's methane lakes and Enceladus' water plumes.",
    image: '/assets/missions/cassini.webp',
    achievements: [
        "First landing on a moon in the outer Solar System (Titan)",
        'Discovered water geysers on Enceladus',
        'Orbited Saturn 294 times'
    ],
    instruments: [
        'Huygens Probe',
        'Imaging Science Subsystem',
        'Cosmic Dust Analyzer',
        'Visible and Infrared Spectrometer'
    ],
    funFacts: [
        "Huygens' descent through Titan's atmosphere took 2.5 hours",
        'Cassini deliberately crashed into Saturn to protect Enceladus from contamination',
        'Transmitted over 450,000 images during its mission'
    ],
    motivation: "After Voyager's flybys, Saturn's mysteries demanded closer study. Titan's thick atmosphere hid its surface. Cassini-Huygens was designed for a comprehensive 4-year mission (extended to 13 years).",
    context: 'Cassini was a joint NASA/ESA mission—one of the most ambitious ever. It took 7 years just to reach Saturn. The Huygens probe was built by ESA to land on Titan, the only moon with a dense atmosphere.',
    outcome: "Cassini transformed our understanding of Saturn. It discovered that Enceladus shoots water into space (potential for life!), Titan has methane lakes and rivers, and Saturn's rings are dynamic and young. The Grand Finale dove between Saturn and its rings before plunging into the planet.",
    legacy: 'Cassini is one of the most successful planetary missions ever. Its discovery of Enceladus\' subsurface ocean made it a prime target for astrobiology. The Titan data may inspire future missions to explore its methane seas.'
